James Burton, youngest son of . . . James Burton and Rosemond Clarkson, was born 6th of June 1800 in Gayle of Hawes, Yorkshire England.  Gayle is a small hamlet near Hawes, which is a Chapelry in Parish of Aysgarth.  Gayle records were kept in Hawes.<p>Isabella Walton was born 7 April 1802.  The Quaker Records gave Buttersett of Hawes as the place of her birth, but her Patriarchal Blessing gives Dent, Yorkshire, England.  They were Quakers.  They were probably able financially to give their two children some educational opportunities.  Her brother, four years her senior, was head booker of a large firm operating coal mines in the vicinity of town, Bishop Auckland, Durham, England.  He had an income of 400 pounds sterling, and was able to give his three living children good educations.  This uncle and his family were probably the inspiration that made nephew, William Walton Burton, so determined to get a good education in spite of poverty and difficulties.<p>Since we find in Gayle and Hawes, both our Burton and Walton families it seems reasonable that James Burton and Isabella Walton knew one another as children.  Later in Hawes Parish Register, ÉÓMarriage of James Burton of Bradford Moor in Parish of Bradford, and Isabella Walton of Gayle in this Chapelry, married by License 5 March 1825.  Her brother was one of the witnesses to their marriage.<p>* * * * <p>While living in Bradford, some of their children learned vocations.  Robert became a blacksmith, also learned to play the violin; William became a wool comber (some of his older children remember seeing his wool combs); James worked with wood and became a joiner; Isabella and Rose learned to spin and weave cloth.<p>Here in Bradford, there was a congregation, who had left the Methodist New Connection Church, that met together every Sabbath, worshipped God as well as they knew how, and prayed that [God] would send them the pure gospel.  It was while meeting with this grou0, that James and Isabella Burton and their family heard the Latter-day Saint Missionaries preach the gospel.  They believed that they taught the same gospel that Jesus Christ and his apostles taught, so on June 4, 1842 they were baptized.  Their children were baptized later.<p>James Burton died of cholera 18 July 1849, at the age of 49 years and 12 days, leaving nine children for his widow to look after, the youngest only 2 years old.  His early death was a great shock to his wife and family.  The oldest son, Robert, had emigrated to Utah some time before with his Uncle Robert, for whom he had been named.  So sixteen-year- old William had to do all he could to help his mother support the family.<p>About two years later, the president of the mission asked her if she was willing for her son William to go on a mission, and stated that he had been impressed to call upon him to go and preach the gospel.  Her eyes filled with tears, realizing that it would deprive her of her sonÕs much needed help, but her answer was positive, ÒIf the Lord wants him, I am willing for him to go.Ó<p>When the appointed time came for him to start on his mission, from the little money he had saved, he purchased a dress for his mother, and an entire suit of clothes for himself.  The remainder of the money he left at home, as the elders were required to preach the gospel without purse or script.<p>We do not have a complete record of how she met her problems.  Her daughters Isabella and Rose got work in the factory weaving cloth.  They had to be at work at 6 oÕclock in the morning and had to walk 3 miles there and 3 miles back after having stood at their looms all day.  Margaret, the next daughter, had to do all she could to help for her mother had to work to get a little money where she could.<p>One of Isabella Walton BurtonÕs outstanding skills was knitting.  She used a sheath or shield in which to hold her knitting needles, and worked so rapidly that her needles could not be seen, only the clicking of the needles could be heard.  In an evening she could make a pair of socks.<p>After William returned from his mission, they decided it was best for him to go to America, find his brother Robert, and the two of them prepare a home and send for their mother and the family.  He went on to Utah and met his brother Robert, and together they were able to send for them.  The family sailed for America on the 22nd of April 1855 on Ship Samuel Curling.  They were listed on the shipÕs records as follows:<br>	Age:  	52 Isabella Burton<br>		22 Isabella Burton<br>		19 Rosemond Burton<br>		17 James Burton ‹ Occupation, Joiner<br>		15 Margaret (Margrete) Burton<br>		12 Christopher Burton<br>		10 Mary Burton<br>		 8 Thomas Burton<p>They arrived in New York on the 22nd of May 1855, and then traveled by train to St. Louis and then on to Kansas.  Isabella and her seven children crossed the plains in the 8th Company of Captain Milo Andrus and arrived in Salt Lake City on 24 October 1855.<p>A granddaughter recalls ÒAndrus was not a very kind man. . . . He was a hard taskmaster.  Grandmother was not very strong, being of slight figure, [and] it was hard for her to walk so much, so sometimes she stole a ride to help her along.  One day as she was climbing in a wagon she fell.  The wheel passed over her leg and broke the bone.  It was set and bandaged and doctored by plasters of cow manure.Ó (Mary Rushford Peart)<p>They walked about 20 miles a day, crossed many rivers on foot and would be very weary at night.  When they camped at night after eating their scanty meal, they would have prayers and sing, ÒWhy should we mourn or think our lot is hard, Ôtis not so, all is well.Ó  Food was scarce; their flour was weighed out to them, and many times they had very little to eat.<p>At Fort Bridger they were met by IsabellaÕs two oldest sons, Robert and William with provisions.  They settled in Kaysville, Utah, and for awhile stayed at RobertÕs home located on what is now known as the Greener Farm.<p>The winter of 1855 was known as the Ôhard winter.Õ  They had very little food.  For six weeks they did not taste bread.  What little wheat flour they had they used for thickening soup, which was made from an old cow that was so thin it couldnÕt stand up.  In the spring of that year, their food consisted mainly of greens, being made from nettles or other kinds of weeds.<p>Isabella Walton Burton was given a Patriarchal Blessing by Isaac Morley in Kaysville, Utah, 7 September 1857.  It states that she was the daughter of William and Isabella Walton and was born at Dent, Yorkshire, England.  She was promised that her children would bless and honor her, that she should have peace of mind, would enjoy health and her last days would be her best days.  Because of her integrity, she was beloved by the Lord.<p>The latter part of her life she lived in Kaysville with William and Rachel Burton.  They had been away from home and upon returning asked her how she was feeling.  She said ÒOh, I feel so fine I could jump over the moon,Ó but that very night she took sick and died 30 March 1863.  She had an egg and a cup of tea for her supper.  They thought it was the egg that caused it, for she had had one for her breakfast, and her stomach could never digest eggs very well.  It was too much for her.<p>She was buried in Kaysville in a homemade coffin made out of a pine log by her son-in-law, Samuel Rushforth.<p></body></html>
